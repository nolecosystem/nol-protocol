🧬 NOL Protocol

**NOL** is a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain that replaces financial capital with verifiable contribution. No staking, no presale—just on-chain reputation, fair rewards, and deterministic consensus. Powered by **Proof of Nothing (PoN)**, NOL finalizes blocks in under 1 second with zero forks, zero inflation, and full transparency.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔐 **Proof of Nothing (PoN):** Finality <1s using VDF + BLS, without staking or mining  
- 🧠 **On-Chain Reputation:** Soulbound badges + builder score = governance rights & rewards  
- 💰 **Transparent Tokenomics:** 1M $NOL fixed supply, distributed 100% via contribution  
- 🤝 **Reputation-Based Governance:** Vote weight = reputation, not wallet balance  
- 🚫 **Zero Presale / Zero VC:** Everyone starts at zero—ownership is earned, not bought
